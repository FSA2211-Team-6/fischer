Fischer is a Chrome extension that distinguishes fact from fiction across the internet using a combination of AI verification and crowdsourced information. Users can browse any website and see highlighted sentences whose colors are determined by the calculated "truthiness" of its content. Fischer doubles as a web app where these pieces of information are sent to and commented on and where other websites are charted based on how truthful the information they output is.
